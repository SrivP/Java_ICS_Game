Hello Ms. S! Hope your day is going well!


Thank you for taking the time to play this little game by Surya and Srivathsan. This game isn't meant to be overly complicated, but is meant to be simple to enjoy by everyone. Our game revolves around the protagonist, you!, and the random villians you massacre on your journey through the cosmos, travelling from jungles, to even outerspace. 


How to use it:

While designing, we kept simplicity and usability at top. In turn, this game should be incredibly easy to use. After running the game, you will be booted into a screen with 3 options.
* Instructions: Outlines the basic control scheme of the game
* Quit: Please don't click this yet! (Meant to exit the game and end the program)
* Play: Pressing this button leads you into a seperate "Levels" panel, which contains 3 different options, 
	* Level 1, 
	* Level 2  
	* Level 3. 
* With Level 1 being the easiest and Level 3 being the hardest!



We also have 3 seperate projectiles!, as outlined here:
- Normal Projectile: Travels in a normal straight line
- Follow Projectiles: Follows the specified sprite
- Pacman: Follows the sprite, spawns randomly in Level 3 while also causing massive amount of damage upon contact
- Blachole: Spawns once enemy health drops below 80% in Level 3, causes instant death upon contact

But you may be asking youself Ms. S, what makes our game so different, well our game is different because we added in 2 extra features that will help players out in tough times. 
1. The "Q" key:
	- When this key is pressed in Level 3, it triggers a special ability, which stops all projectile movement in the game (however it doesn't stop spawining news ones, so it's important to be careful). This gives the player a little bit of time (around 5 seconds), to calm down.
2. The "Backspace" key:
	- When you hit the backspace key in Level 3, it enables game cheats, which allows all the player's bullets to follow the constantly moving enemy, making it significantly easier to beat the boss (and grade our project quicker!!).




How to Run:

In order to run our program, you simply have to run the Run.bat file!!
